// The English text is the key (see ui/src/lib/i18n.ts), so this finds every
// `t("...")` in the UI and compares. An empty value means "not translated
// yet" and shows the English, which is why adding a key never breaks a
// screen and a volunteer can translate as much or as little as they like.
//
// Only double-quoted literals are read. `t(someVariable)` cannot be found by
// reading the source, so a label passed through a variable -- the nav tabs
// are the example -- has to appear as a literal somewhere this script can
// see; see LITERALS below.

/**
 * Something is wrong with the database, and it is worth saying so before the
 * app asks for anything else.
 *
 * Two ways to get here, and they are not the same:
 *
 * * **empty** — the database opened and holds nothing. A wipe looks exactly
 *   like a new install: no config, no matches, a setup screen asking for a
 *   SteamID, and a fresh download of twelve years of logs with a 200 MB copy
 *   sitting in the folder next door.
 * * **unreadable** — it would not open at all, so it was moved aside and a
 *   fresh one took its place. This used to end at "Could not start" with no
 *   way forward, which is how 25 September 2026 went.

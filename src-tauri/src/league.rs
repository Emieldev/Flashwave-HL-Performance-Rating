//! The league sample running in the background (Flashy): one step at a
//! time, for as long as the app is open and the sample is switched on.
//!
//! The pace is the point. logs.tf has banned this address for asking too
//! much, so a step is one request and the loop waits between steps; while
//! logs.tf is resting, more.tf gives the JSON instead; and while the owner's
//! own sync runs the sample waits, so their games come first. Everything it
//! has done is in the database: closing the app loses nothing but the wait.
//!
//! What it is doing right now is kept in [`Activity`], for the live bar in
//! Settings: without it a job that waits most of the time looks stuck.

//! The league sample (Flashy, September 2026): ETF2L Highlander officials
//! from every division, so ratings can be read against the league instead
//! of only the owner's matches, and a player can be told which division the
//! people they play against come from.
//!
//! **Finding them is cheap.** ETF2L's results give every official's division
//! and tier ([`crate::leagues::fetch_seasons`]); trends.tf lists every ETF2L
//! Highlander log with the ETF2L match it belongs to. Joined, every log has
//! a division without asking logs.tf anything.
//!
//! **Choosing them** ([`select`]): per tier, [`MATCHES_PER_TIER`] matches,
//! from the last [`PREFER_YEARS`] years unless that cannot fill it, taken
//! round-robin across maps so every map in the pool is in there.
//!
//! **Downloading them is slow on purpose** ([`step`]): one unit of work a
//! call, and the caller waits between calls. logs.tf's JSON first, then its
//! raw server logs; while logs.tf is refusing us, more.tf's copy stands in
//! for the JSON. ETF2L's match pages (who played) come alongside, from a
//! different host. Everything is state in the database, so it picks up
//! wherever it was after a restart.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the owner's matches: the sample lives in its own
//! tables (migration 0033) until it is decided how it should count.

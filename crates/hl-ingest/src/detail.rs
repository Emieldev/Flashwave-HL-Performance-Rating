/// A match as the page reads it: the scoreboard from the log, plus the two
/// things that come from the database instead.
///
/// This type exists because those two used to be added by the Tauri command
/// and nowhere else. `get_match` wrapped a `MatchDetail` with `context` and
/// `segments` and flattened it, so the page received one object with all
/// three; `get_parts` and `fetch_part` returned a bare `MatchDetail`. The
/// TypeScript declared a single type for both and asserted it at the
/// `invoke` boundary, where nothing checks it — so picking one half of a
/// combined log handed the page an object whose `segments` was `undefined`,
/// and the header's `d.segments.map(...)` threw. Building the page's shape
/// once, here, is what stops the two paths drifting apart again.

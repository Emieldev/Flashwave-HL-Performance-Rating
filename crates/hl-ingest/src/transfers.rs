//! ETF2L transfers (Q48, Flashy; PLAN §27): who joined and left a team, and
//! when.
//!
//! ETF2L lists them per team (`/team/{id}/transfers`) and per player
//! (`/player/{id}/transfers`), newest first, twenty to a page. They are read
//! once and kept; a list read before is read again only until a page brings
//! nothing new. What they are for:
//!
//! - medals: a team's medal is for the players still on it at its last
//!   match of the season, not one who left in week two;
//! - a team page's roster history, and how long each player stayed;
//! - a profile's teams with the dates they were on them.

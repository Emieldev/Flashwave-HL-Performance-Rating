/**
 * Who turned up to each fight, and how together (Q7b, Taiga's ask).
 *
 * The question Highlander players argue about after a lost round, which no
 * scoreboard answers: did we go in as one, or trickle in to die one at a
 * time? A player is in a fight from the first moment they deal or take
 * damage, kill, or die — so a Soldier who lands two rockets and lives was
 * there, where a kill feed says he never was.
 *
 * **How much of a side went in together**: the share of it that joined
 * within three seconds of that side's own first arrival. This replaced the
 * obvious measure -- the gap between a side's first and last arrival --
 * after it was tried on a real match and called 0 of 51 teamfights
 * together. With eight or nine players a side there is nearly always one
 * who arrives late for a good reason, a Sniper at the back or a respawn,
 * and the gap measures them rather than the collapse. "6 of 8 in together"
 * does not care about the one.

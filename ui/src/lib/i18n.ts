/**
 * Translations (Q13 — tenshi, with boSe on French and obi on Portuguese and
 * Spanish).
 *
 * **The English text is the key.** `t("Matches")` looks "Matches" up in the
 * chosen language's file and falls back to the English when there is no
 * entry. That is the whole design, and it is chosen for the volunteers
 * rather than for the code:
 *
 * - A translator sees exactly the sentence they are translating, not an
 *   invented key like `nav.matches` they have to find on screen to
 *   understand.
 * - A missing translation is never a blank or a key leaking onto the page:
 *   it is the English, which is what the app said yesterday.
 * - No string has to be moved to a table before it can be translated. It is
 *   wrapped where it is, which matters while the screens are still moving —
 *   the plan's warning about Q13 is that every string moved twice is a
 *   string translated twice.
 *
 * The cost is that fixing a typo in the English orphans its translations.
 * `npm run i18n` lists every key and every file's missing and stale ones,
 * so that shows up as a diff rather than a silent regression.
 *
 * The choice is per machine, like the theme, and lives in localStorage for
 * the same reason: it has to be readable before the first paint.
 *
 * Each language is a plain `.lang` file (see ./langfile.ts). The shipped
 * ones are built in from `lang/`; files in the user's own lang folder are
 * laid over them at start and on Reload, so a player can fix a line, see it
 * straight away, and send the file back to be shipped for everyone.

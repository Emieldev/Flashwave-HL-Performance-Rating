//! Noticing a demo the moment TF2 finishes writing it.
//!
//! The point is the alt-tab: you finish a match, switch out, and the game is
//! already on the page with its rating on it. Until now the app only looked
//! at the demos folder at startup and after a sync you asked for, so a match
//! you had just played was the one thing it could not show you.
//!
//! **Polling, not a filesystem watcher.** A demo is written continuously
//! while the match runs, so a change event fires hundreds of times and means
//! nothing; what matters is the file being *finished*, which no event
//! reports. Polling every few seconds and waiting for the size to stop
//! moving says exactly that, costs a directory listing, and needs no new
//! dependency.

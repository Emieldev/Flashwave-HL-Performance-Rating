//! The league sample in the rating pool (Flashy, September 2026).
//!
//! A rating says how a game compares with the pool of games on the same
//! class. That pool was only the owner's own matches -- a few hundred logs
//! from wherever the owner plays, with the owner left out so nobody was
//! compared with themselves. The league sample adds officials from every
//! ETF2L division, so the pool is the league: "1.00" is a typical league
//! game, and the owner is in it like everyone else (one Sniper among a few
//! thousand, where they had been half the Sniper pool of their own matches).
//!
//! Each sample log goes through exactly what an owner's log goes through --
//! kills valued by victim, map and situation, the fights pass (openings,
//! trades, Fight KAST, caps), the shared swing -- only in memory, from the
//! downloaded JSON and raw server log, because none of it is stored: the
//! sample's games are never written to the owner's match or rating tables.

 * A demo appearing means a match has just been played.
 *
 * The backend watches the TF2 folders and says when a recording is finished.
 * That is the earliest this app can know you played, and it is the moment
 * the page should be worth alt-tabbing to — so the sync starts itself, and
 * a card says what is happening rather than leaving the window to change on
 * its own for no visible reason.
 *
 * logs.tf is not instant: the upload lands seconds to a minute or two after
 * the server stops. So the app waits ten seconds, then looks every five for
 * two minutes, and syncs the moment the log is there.

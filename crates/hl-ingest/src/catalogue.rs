//! Player profiles (Q35, Flashy; PLAN §26): who everyone in the league is,
//! from the ETF2L officials the league job has downloaded and who played
//! them.
//!
//! **Seasons.** Each official says who played it and for which team; a
//! player's season is the teams they played for, the division each was in,
//! and the record. Playoff matches carry no division of their own, so theirs
//! comes from the competition's name ("Low Playoffs") and its tier from that
//! season's regular matches in the same division.
//!
//! **Medals.** Worked out, not fetched -- ETF2L's API has no awards. For
//! each season and division: a playoff Grand Final gives gold to its winner
//! and silver to its loser, and a 3rd Place match gives bronze. A division
//! with no playoffs (Premiership, High and Mid in several seasons) is settled
//! by its final table -- won, then map score -- and only once the season is
//! over. A player earns their team's medal by playing at least one official
//! for it that season.
//!
//! **Which division a player is** (Flashy, ETF2L's own rule): in a season,
//! a division counts for them if they played at least [`MIN_FOR_DIVISION`]
//! officials in it, or played in the Grand Final of the division one below
//! (the finalists move up). Where both apply, the higher one. One merc game
//! in Premiership makes nobody a Premiership player. Their highest division
//! is the best one that counted in any season; every per-season division
//! -- the tags on a match, the ranks -- follows the same rule.

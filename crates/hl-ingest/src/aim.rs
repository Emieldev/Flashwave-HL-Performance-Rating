//! Aim in one match, read from its demo (PLAN §14, Q16b).
//!
//! The demo knows the shot exactly: it carries its own kill events, stamped
//! with the tick. The log knows what the kill was: the victim's class, the
//! weapon, whether it was a headshot. This joins the two.
//!
//! The join is by victim and time. A demo's start is an estimate (file time
//! minus its own duration), so demo time and log time can sit a few seconds
//! apart; a kill of the same victim within [`JOIN_WINDOW_S`] is the same kill,
//! and the closest one wins. A kill with no match in the log still comes back,
//! with what the demo alone knows.
//!
//! **Whose aim gets stored.** The pass itself answers for every player the
//! demo carried, but not every answer is worth keeping:
//!
//! - An **STV** demo is the server's own recording. It carries all eighteen
//!   players throughout, with the angles the server had, so every one of them
//!   is stored.
//! - A **POV** demo is one client's. It carries its recorder always and
//!   everyone else only while the recorder could see them, with eye angles
//!   quantized for the wire rather than sampled from a mouse. Only the
//!   recorder is stored from one.
//!
//! This is the same rule routes already follow, and it is why the Aim tab can
//! now answer for a teammate on a match with an STV demo and says plainly
//! that it cannot on a match with only your own.
